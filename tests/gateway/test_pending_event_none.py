"""Tests for pending follow-up extraction in recursive _run_agent calls.

When pending_event is None (Path B: pending comes from interrupt_message),
accessing pending_event.channel_prompt previously raised AttributeError.
This verifies the fix: channel_prompt is captured inside the
`if pending_event is not None:` block and falls back to None otherwise.

Also verifies that internal control interrupt reasons like "Stop requested"
do not get recycled into the pending-user-message follow-up path.
